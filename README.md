# sql-challenge
For this assignment, I used SQL and Jupyter Notebook to conduct a research project for a fictitious company named "Pewlett Hackard" and their employees during the 1980s-1990s. The assignment involved Data Modeling (ERD Diagram), Data Engineering (Table Schemata), and Data Analysis (Querying). In addition, there is a bonus section which contains a histogram of the common salary ranges of a Pewlett Hackard employee and a bar graph of the average Pewlett Hackard employee salaries grouped by their title.
