# sql-challenge
This repo contains my sql homework. For this assignment, I used SQL and Jupyter Notebook to conduct a research project for a fictitious company named "Pewlett Hackard" and their employees during the 1980s-1990s. The assignment involved Data Modeling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis.
